# CSS-JavaScript-and-HTML-Quiz

+ This is an example of a coding quiz. Coding quizzes are sometimes use in job interviews for web developers, especially in more junior roles, to assess their knowledge of coding languages. They are also used to determine how the interviewee responds to a knowledge deficit. This particular quiz was designed mostly with Javascript to highlight my knowledge of the aforementioned language. 

## Description

+ This page includes the quiz noted above, but also includes a form, a timer, and changing pseudo elements to show the developers ability to design an interactive webpage. 
+ While the quiz itself is, ofcourse, interactive, so are other parts of the page. 

+ you will note that the timer button starts after the user clicks the start quiz button, and that the answer buttons change color when the user hovers over them. This functionality shows knowledge of css and javascript outside of the knowledge shown with the quiz responses.

The following animation demonstrates what the application should do when it is complete:
